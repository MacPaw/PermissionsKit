![Calendar](https://github.com/MacPaw/PermissionsKit/raw/master/Screenshots/logo.png)

The convenient wrapper on macOS permissions API. 

Current implementation supports permissions for: 

* [Calendar](#calendar)
* [Contacts](#contacts)
* [Reminders](#reminders)
* [Photos](#photos)
* [Full Disk Access](#full-disk-access)

## Usage

Available types:
```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, MPPermissionType) {
    MPPermissionTypeCalendar = 0,
    MPPermissionTypeReminders,
    MPPermissionTypeContacts,
    MPPermissionTypePhotos,
    MPPermissionTypeFullDiskAccess
} NS_SWIFT_NAME(PermissionType);
```

Get permissions status:
```objc
/**
 * Requests current authorization status for a given type.
 *
 * @discussion It is safe to call this method on system where permission type is not supported. MPAuthorizationStatusAuthorized will be returned.
 *
 * @param permissionType MPPermissionType
 * @return MPAuthorizationStatus
 */
+ (MPAuthorizationStatus)authorizationStatusForPermissionType:(MPPermissionType)permissionType;
```

Ask for permissions:
```objc
/**
 * Requests user authorization for a given permission. Completion will be invoked with a user decision. Completion queue is undefined.
 * @discussion There will be no completion when requesting MPPermissionTypeFullDiskAccess, because its status is unknown. You should implement your own callback mechanism, for example - polling authorization. It is safe to call this method on system where permission type is not supported. MPAuthorizationStatusAuthorized will be returned.
 *
 * @param permissionType MPPermissionType
 * @param completionHandler void (^)(MPAuthorizationStatus status)
 */
+ (void)requestAuthorizationForPermissionType:(MPPermissionType)permissionType withCompletion:(void (^)(MPAuthorizationStatus status))completionHandler;
```

## Calendar
10.9+

![Calendar](https://github.com/MacPaw/PermissionsKit/raw/master/Screenshots/calendar.png)

`NSCalendarsUsageDescription` key in info.plist is required.

## Contacts
10.11+

![Contacts](https://github.com/MacPaw/PermissionsKit/raw/master/Screenshots/contacts.png)

:warning:Uses **Private API** for calling permissions, because public one is not working properly. See [rdar://34158737](http://www.openradar.me/34158737)

`NSContactsUsageDescription` key is required in Info.plist

## Reminders
10.9+

![Reminders](https://github.com/MacPaw/PermissionsKit/raw/master/Screenshots/reminders.png)

`NSRemindersUsageDescription` key is required in Info.plist

## Photos
10.13+

:warning:Works only for Photos Extensions. See [rdar://34431396](http://www.openradar.me/34431396) and [rdar://43426722](http://www.openradar.me/43426722)

`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` key is required in Info.plist

## Full Disk Access
10.14+

![FDA](https://github.com/MacPaw/PermissionsKit/raw/master/Screenshots/full_disk_access.png)

Since there is no legal API to request Full Disk Access permissions on macOS 10.14, this is the only workaround to get and ask for it.

:warning:There will be no callback when requesting this type of permission, so you should use your own implementation such as polling permission status, or use other events to handle possible permission change (for example handle `NSApp` foreground/background status).
Calling for permissions opens Preferences->Privacy with selected "Full Disk Access" section. 

## Application Sandbox:

PermissionsKit can be used in sandboxed applications. But this application should have access to the file
`Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist`.
You can do it using Security-Scoped Bookmarks flow, more details in [apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AppSandboxInDepth/AppSandboxInDepth.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011183-CH3-SW16)
Or for testing purposes you can add temporary-exception to your .entitlements file.

```
<key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-only</key>
<array>
	<string>Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist</string>
</array>
```

For more details please check [Full Disk Access](#full-disk-access) details.

## Requirements

macOS 10.9+
However different kinds of permissions require different system version it is safe to call for authorization witout actual system check. `MPAuthorizationStatusAuthorized` will be returned in this case.

## Example 

See PermissionsKitTestApp target
